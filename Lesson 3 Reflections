When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Working with multiple persons at remote locations it may be necessary to keep everyone updated by pushing changes to working files to
  the remote repository from time to time.  Also simple things such as working from home and forgetting to bring your USB into work, well
  if you updated the remote repository then you can access your updates anyway.
